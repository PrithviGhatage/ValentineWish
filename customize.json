  "wishText": "From the moment you walked into my life, things just felt different. Calmer. Brighter. Real. You have this way of making ordinary days feel special without even trying. I don’t say it enough, but I genuinely admire your strength, your heart, and the way you care so deeply about the people around you. Being with you feels like home. And no matter where life takes us, I want you to know — choosing you is the easiest decision I make every single day. Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. ❤️ ",
